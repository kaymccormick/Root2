# Root2

Experiments with wpf, roslyn, xaml, and dependency injection.
Goal is a borerline-usable roslyn-based c# analyzis platform. Reality is more of a
testbed for experimentation at this point.

Feature notes:
* XAML-integrated Autofac-based dependency resolution support.
  * Resolve enumerated lists of objects into XAML properties.
* Various levels of appliation scaffolding for Analyzer support.
* Attempt at assembly factoring to separate UI implementation and dependencies
  from general application API support.
